1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem I was trying to solve for the project of the course would be what data structure would be the best option for the Course Loading Project that was to be completed. 

2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

In order to approach the problem, I had to learn about each individual data structure in the class and then determine which one would be the best fit for each situation. Because every scenario is different and has different data and or requirements, it is important to know which structure is the most efficient to use for each scenario you come across.

3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I spent a lot of time reading over tutorials and or trying to find videos that would help with any problems I encountered. For instance, I often checked the W3Schools website and a few others to see if my syntax was correct, or I would check ZyBooks as well. I do believe I used SNHU's advising once or twice too.

4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

It opened my eyes to three new data structures that I was not aware of beforehand. It definitely helped sharpen up my way of creating pseudocodes, which I believe I struggled with all the way at the beginning of starting the CS courses.

5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I definitely think that I got better at adding comments to my work, and following along the pseudocodes that I made to double check my work and structure it better. Instead of throwing myself at an assignment and or a personal project blindly like I am so used to doing due to my enthusiasm, I think I will now try to slow down and use pseudocodes more to structure things so that it makes the coding progress more manageable and less time consuming to do.
